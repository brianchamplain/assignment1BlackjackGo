Starter code and unit tests for Assignment 1

## Running the Tests

Note that to run the tests, you will need to move the `.cpp` file out of the directory, otherwise the `go test` command will complain. After you have removed that file, with your working directory set to the one containing your Go sources, you can simply run:
```
go test
```
And four unit tests against your `calculateScore()` function will be run.
